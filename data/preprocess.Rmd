## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Thư viện
```{r}

library(dplyr)  #Provide manipulate functions
library(tidyr) #Tidy dataframe
# library(rmarkdown)
```

```{r}
covidData <- read_csv("./data/owid-covid-data.csv", show_col_types=FALSE)
covidData <- covidData %>% select(location, date, new_deaths, total_deaths, new_cases, total_cases, new_tests, total_tests, positive_rate, people_fully_vaccinated, icu_patients, hosp_patients, reproduction_rate, population, ) %>% filter(location == 'United States')
print(covidData)
write.csv(covidData, 'usa.csv')
```
